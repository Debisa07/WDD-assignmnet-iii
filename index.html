                                <p>
                                    I am Debisa Abebe a Software engineering student at AAiT. I'm from Ethiopia which is a
                                    country full of culture and history which dates back hundreeds and thousends of years. I
                                    love eating and hanging out with my friends .I'm currently a software engineering student and I gained some skills through out my school years which I intend to word
                                    on now and for sure in the future. Software engineering is all about designig, developing, maintenance, testing, and
                                    evaluation of computer software. Which is a preety interesting cource.
                                </p>

                        <table>
                            <p> To make a living is one and major reason for me to do this. plus as said before it's interesting in a way you get to see
                            things you do right away plus you'll in most cases just need a computer and some softwares to work with.My first programming language to get a grasp of is python. it's a relatively new language but has been utilized
                            intensively so I'm glad I got the skill and I want to build upon it further more since programming is ever growing thing
                            and there is always something to learn.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>That leading me to my next point, one should love him/her self fiest before thinking to love others.The love and
                            appreciation we got for our selves is what pushes us to live to our fullest and keep us from doing self destructing
                            things that most people do in their day to day life..</p>
                                    <h3>Interested in</h3>
                                    <p>Now codding is one part of my life. I will be codding whenever I got free time. Coddind webpages is very interesting and
                                    powerful tool. You can create lots of impressive display using it.
                                    I always push my self to be able to learn new things. I don't enjoy reading but I try to take some other measures to
                                    learn like videos audio books and some others. I've always wanted to be an acadamia so I'll always push forward to
                                    achieve it.
</p>    <br>
<p>Who doesn't like sport. I love sport specially football and basketball. Watching football matches is one of the most
interesting yet goosebumps giving exxperiance especially when my team is in the field. By the way I'm a big fan of
tothenam.

I spend much of my time on the internet. I like surfing on the web as most would agree. And now days It's become
mandatory for me to use it for study and also for the soul purpose of relaxation. And youtube is the major I use next to
stackoverflow</p>
<br>
<h3>Hobbies</h3>
<p>Movies are the things I ran to whenever I dont have much to do. It's fun especially when it's comedy. Ilove comedy
movies.

I dont need to say much about food. It's our basic need plus it's delicois. so I enjoy eating. Thats why it's in my
hobby list....funny right.

That leading me to my next point, one should love him/her self fiest before thinking to love others.The love and
appreciation we got for our selves is what pushes us to live to our fullest and keep us from doing self destructing
things that most people do in their day to day life.</p>
