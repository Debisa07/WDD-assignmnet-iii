                <p>ello there! My name is Steven Kinnear. I’m a Physician, Freelance Consultant, Philomath and Doctorpreneur.
                Physician
                
                I’m a GP Principal at Silverbirch Medical Practice in Bangor, Co. Down. Prior to undertaking training in General
                Practice on the North Down rotation I was a Medical Manager at the Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland for
                three years and prior to this I was a Registrar in Acute Medicine. I was formerly a GMC Associate for Visits to
                Deaneries. I was then appointed as a GMC Fitness to Practice Panellist through open competition before transferring to
                the Interim Orders Panel under the new Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal Service (MPTS).
                Freelance Consultant
                
                I love variety and novel challenges, and I love to solve problems and get things done, so I decided to start using my
                skills in new ways by doing consultancy work. I now run my own small consultancy business that focuses on leadership and
                improvement with a special focus on healthcare, and through this I have worked with a number of companies in the
                healthcare field as well as several non-healthcare businesses, helping them to take forward innovative ideas, generate
                business models and improve their performance.
                Philomath
                
                I love to learn and I continually seek to understand the world I live in. I like to read about history, sociology,
                politics, philosophy, business, finance, and anything related to maximising human potential. You can find out about some
                of my favourite books here.
                Doctorpreneur
                
                I’m a doctor that applies entrepreneurial thinking in healthcare (and outside healthcare too). In my clinical and
                management jobs in the health service I always look for opportunities for improvement and challenge the status quo.
                
                I promote medical leadership and doctorpreneurialism through courses and conferences including the first series of
                annual Northern Ireland Medical Leadership Symposiums. The last symposium – MLS2013 – was on Friday 21 June 2013 in
                Titanic Belfast. You can find out more on the dedicated Medical Leadership Symposium website
                http://medleadsymposium.co.uk.
                
                I am the founder of HSC Changeday, an initiative to bring the NHS Changeday movement to Northern Ireland. I led a team
                of volunteers from various parts of the HSC to deliver the first HSC Changeday on 3 March 2014 and we celebrated the
                second, bigger and better change day on 11 March 2015. Check out the HSC Changeday website and follow HSC Changeday on
                Twitter.
                
                This is my personal website where I plan to write about the things I’m interested in, share what I’m learning and give
                updates on the interesting work and projects I’m involved in. You can also hire me to help you, your team, or your
                organisation to solve a problem or improve your performance.</p>
