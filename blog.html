                                HTML5 was the fifth and current major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The
                                current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser

                                JavaScript® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class
                                functions,
                                and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
                                It is
                                a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and
                                functional programming styles.
                                JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the
                                occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for
                                controlling
                                web page behavior.
                                Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic
                                scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both
                                Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language. Language constructs, such as if
                                statements, for and while loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as in these languages (or
                                nearly

                                Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and
                                specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application
                                developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support
                                Java
                                without the need for recompilation.
                                For example, you can write and compile a Java program on UNIX and run it on Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, or UNIX
                                machine without any modifications to the source code. WORA is achieved by compiling a Java program into an
                                intermediate
                                language called bytecode. The format of bytecode is platform-independent. A virtual machine, called the Java Virtual
                                Machine (JVM), is used to run the bytecode on each platform.

                            <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first
                                released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant
                                whitespace.
                                Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
                                large-scale projects.
                                Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
                                object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
                                comprehensive standard library.
                                Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced
                                features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python
                                3.0,
                                released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2
                                code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
                                The Python 2 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued on 1 January 2020 (first planned for 2015)
                                after
                                which security patches and other improvements will not be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python
                                3.5.x and later are supported.
                                Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and
                                maintains
                                CPython, an open source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages
                                and
                                directs resources for Python and CPython development.
