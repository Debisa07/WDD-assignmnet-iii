                    <p>Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first
                    released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
                    Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and
                    large-scale projects.
                    Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural,
                    object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
                    comprehensive standard library.
                    Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced
                    features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles. Python 3.0,
                    released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2
                    code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
                    The Python 2 language, i.e. Python 2.7.x, was officially discontinued on 1 January 2020 (first planned for 2015) after
                    which security patches and other improvements will not be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python
                    3.5.x and later are supported.
                    Python interpreters are available for many operating systems. A global community of programmers develops and maintains
                    CPython, an open source reference implementation. A non-profit organization, the Python Software Foundation, manages and
                    directs resources for Python and CPython development.

<P>
    Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and
    specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application
    developers “write once, run anywhere” (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
    without the need for recompilation.
    For example, you can write and compile a Java program on UNIX and run it on Microsoft Windows, Macintosh, or UNIX
    machine without any modifications to the source code. WORA is achieved by compiling a Java program into an intermediate
    language called bytecode. The format of bytecode is platform-independent. A virtual machine, called the Java Virtual
    Machine (JVM), is used to run the bytecode on each platform.

<h1>C#</h1>

<p>The correct title of this article is C# (programming language). The substitution of the # is due to technical
restrictions C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note C♯, but written with the number sign)[b] is a
general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative,
declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.[16] It
was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative, and later approved as an international standard
by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018). Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a
compiler and runtime for the language. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language
Infrastructure (CLI)</p>

<p>JavaScript
JavaScript® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions,
and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is
a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and
functional programming styles.
JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program how the web pages behave on the
occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling
web page behavior.
Contrary to popular misconception, JavaScript is not "Interpreted Java". In a nutshell, JavaScript is a dynamic
scripting language supporting prototype based object construction. The basic syntax is intentionally similar to both
Java and C++ to reduce the number of new concepts required to learn the language. Language constructs, such as if
statements, for and while loops, and switch and try ... catch blocks function the same as in these languages (or nearly
so).
JavaScript can function as both a procedural and an object oriented language. Objects are created programmatically in
JavaScript, by attaching methods and properties to otherwise empty objects at run time, as opposed to the syntactic
class definitions common in compiled languages like C++ and Java. Once an object has been constructed it can be used as
a blueprint (or prototype) for creating similar objects.
JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables,
dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for ... in), and source code recovery (JavaScript programs
can decompile function bodies back into their source text)

<h1>HTML5</h1>
<p>HTML5 is a software solution stack that defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a
markup-based pattern to it.
HTML5 was the fifth and current major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The
current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained by a consortium of the major browser
vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).
HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation"
status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other
new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices
such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[5]
HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and
rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for
complex web applications.[6] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications,
because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
